# Introduction

In the world of education, creating and managing result sheets is a crucial task for teachers and schools. Right now, teachers use different tools to do this. Some use a basic Excel template provided by the Ministry of Education for consistency. Others, especially in private schools, have developed their own online systems to make the job easier. But there are still many teachers who are stuck doing it all by hand, which is time-consuming and exhausting.
The question we're exploring is whether we can find a better way for everyone, whether they're in private or public schools, to generate result sheets without all the extra work. This means using modern technology to make things simpler and more efficient.
In the following sections, we'll dive into the details of this challenge and the possible solutions to make life easier for educators and improve the way schools handle results.

### Project Marketplace

In the world of school management in Afghanistan, there's a problem. Many schools, especially public ones, don't have a good way to manage their students' result sheets. While it would be great to have a complete School Management Information System, most schools don't have that.
So, there's a gap â€“ a need for a solution that's just about managing result sheets. That's what we're looking at in this project, creating a special tool that can help schools in Afghanistan keep track of their students' results more easily

### Problem Statement

In Afghan schools, there's a big problem with handling student results. The way they currently do it is slow and not very accurate. This means that it's hard for teachers to keep good records of how students are doing, and it's tough for students to get their results on time.
So, we need a better system. We want to make it easier for teachers to keep track of student data, generate result sheets quickly, and have all the year-end results in one place. This will help modernize the education system in Afghanistan and make it work better for everyone.

### What's the problem?

The problem we're tackling is that Afghan schools have a hard time managing and sharing student result data. Their current methods are slow, not very efficient, and make it tough to keep accurate records and deliver results on time for both regular assessments and year-end evaluations. This causes problems for teachers who want to track student progress and for students who want to see their academic records.
So, the main issue here is that Afghan schools lack an efficient system for managing result sheets. This is a roadblock to modernizing the education system. In response to this problem, we are creating an API project that can work with any school's system to make the process smoother and more accessible.

### Research Question

How can we create a system that makes it easy and efficient for Afghan schools to manage and share student result data? We want to focus on student data, result sheet generation, and year-end results. The goal is to make the education system in Afghanistan more modern and improve the experience for both teachers and students.

### Impact of the Problem

The issue of poorly managed student result data in Afghan schools has a bad effect. It makes education less effective, school administration slower, and can even affect how well students do in their studies. This problem is holding back the modernization of the education system and could cause bigger problems for the economy and society.

### Research Goals

Create a system that's good at managing data.
Make education better.
Help students feel more confident.
Make school administration easier.


### Expected Outcomes

An efficient data management system.
Improved educational quality.
Empowered students.
Streamlined administration processes.
