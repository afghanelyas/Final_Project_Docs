# Research Design and Methodology
Agile estimation techniques are collaborative. All appropriate people are
included in the process. For example the whole team participates in esti-
mating effort of Product Backlog Items. Collaborative techniques are also
designed so that it is impossible to blame someone for an incorrect estimate:
there is no way to trace who estimated what. Agile estimation techniques
are designed to be fast (than traditional techniques) and deliberately trade
off accuracy. We are not trying to learn to predict the future or get better at
estimation. Instead, we recognize that estimation is a non-value added ac-
tivity and minimize it as much as possible. Most Agile estimation techniques
use relative units. This means that we dont try to estimate dollars or days
directly. Instead, we use points or even qualitative labels and simply com-
pare the items we are estimating to each other. This takes advantage of the
human capacity to compare things to each other and avoids our difficulty in
comparing something to an abstract concept (such as dollars or days). One
of the key advantages of adopting an agile workflow is the ability of the team
to estimate new work effectively. Over time, as team members encounter
new user stories, they should develop an increasingly accurate sense of how
theyre going to approach stories and how much effort each user story will
take to complete. Once a team has been working together for a while, their
ability to estimate new stories becomes much better. Teams with a history
of past successes and failures can compare their velocity against point es-
timates that everyone can agree to, and as a result they can predict with
reasonable accuracy how difficult it will be for them to complete a new story.
But teams new to agile sometimes have difficulty figuring out how to estimate
stories effectively. For some, the abstract and team-specific concept of points
is difficult to grasp. For others, the soft relationship between point value
and actual time spent working on a story can be distracting. Until a team
has been working together for a while, attempts to generate accurate point
estimates for new stories may feel awkward and loose. Here is a estimation
techniques for agile teams that can ease the transition through this phase.
This technique get everyone engaged in productive point estimation from the
start, regardless of their level of experience with agile methods. Estimating
the cost of an IS development project is one of the most crucial tasks for
project managers [6](Keung et al., 2004)


# API
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a set of rules that helps different software applications have a conversation. It tells them how to ask for things and share information.
Key Parts of an API:
Methods or Endpoints: Think of these as actions. They tell the apps what to do, like getting data, sending data, or doing a specific task.
Request Format: When you talk to an API, you make a request. This is like telling it what you want to do. You might also give it your ID to prove who you are.
Response Format: The API answers back with information or says, "Yep, I did it!" The answer comes in a specific way, like a language the apps understand, such as JSON or XML.
Data Exchange: APIs let apps share all sorts of stuff - words, numbers, pictures, files, or anything they need to talk about. It's like the way they pass notes to each other.

### How dose API work
* Request: You start by asking the API to do something for you. You tell it what you want, and sometimes, you give it extra information.
* Processing: The API gets to work, like a helpful assistant. It might search for information, do some calculations, or talk to other services.
* Response: When it's done, the API sends you a message. This message contains the answers to your request or the information you wanted.
* Integration: Now, your own program can use this information from the API to do its own job or show the data to people. It's like using the results of a task done by your assistant to complete your work.
