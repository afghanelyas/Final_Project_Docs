# Research Design and Methodology
Agile estimation techniques are collaborative. All appropriate people are
included in the process. For example the whole team participates in esti-
mating effort of Product Backlog Items. Collaborative techniques are also
designed so that it is impossible to blame someone for an incorrect estimate:
there is no way to trace who estimated what. Agile estimation techniques
are designed to be fast (than traditional techniques) and deliberately trade
off accuracy. We are not trying to learn to predict the future or get better at
estimation. Instead, we recognize that estimation is a non-value added ac-
tivity and minimize it as much as possible. Most Agile estimation techniques
use relative units. This means that we dont try to estimate dollars or days
directly. Instead, we use points or even qualitative labels and simply com-
pare the items we are estimating to each other. This takes advantage of the
human capacity to compare things to each other and avoids our difficulty in
comparing something to an abstract concept (such as dollars or days). One
of the key advantages of adopting an agile workflow is the ability of the team
to estimate new work effectively. Over time, as team members encounter
new user stories, they should develop an increasingly accurate sense of how
theyre going to approach stories and how much effort each user story will
take to complete. Once a team has been working together for a while, their
ability to estimate new stories becomes much better. Teams with a history
of past successes and failures can compare their velocity against point es-
timates that everyone can agree to, and as a result they can predict with
reasonable accuracy how difficult it will be for them to complete a new story.
But teams new to agile sometimes have difficulty figuring out how to estimate
stories effectively. For some, the abstract and team-specific concept of points
is difficult to grasp. For others, the soft relationship between point value
and actual time spent working on a story can be distracting. Until a team
has been working together for a while, attempts to generate accurate point
estimates for new stories may feel awkward and loose. Here is a estimation
techniques for agile teams that can ease the transition through this phase.
This technique get everyone engaged in productive point estimation from the
start, regardless of their level of experience with agile methods. Estimating
the cost of an IS development project is one of the most crucial tasks for
project managers [6](Keung et al., 2004)


# API
An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

Key Elements of an API:
- Methods or Endpoints: APIs define a set of methods or endpoints that represent specific functionalities or operations. These can include actions like retrieving data, sending data, or performing a task.
- Request Format: When you interact with an API, you send a request to it. The request typically includes information about the method you want to call, any required parameters, and often authentication details.
- Response Format: The API responds to your request with data or a confirmation of the operation. The response is typically structured in a specific format, such as JSON or XML.
- Data Exchange: APIs enable the exchange of data, which can include text, numbers, images, files, or any other type of information that the applications need to share.

### How dose API work
When you use an API, you're essentially asking one software component to perform a specific action on your behalf. Here's a simplified breakdown of how APIs work:
- Request: You make a request to the API, specifying what action you want it to perform and providing any necessary data or parameters.
- Processing: The API processes your request, which may involve querying a database, performing calculations, or interacting with other services.
- Response: The API sends back a response, which includes the results of the requested action or the data you've asked for.
- Integration: Your application can then use the data or results from the API response to perform its own functions or present the information to users.
