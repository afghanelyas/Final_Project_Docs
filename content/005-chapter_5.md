# Implementation
Using Laravel API and Postman for testing is a common and effective choice for implementing and testing APIs. 

### Technologies
When we want to develop any software choosing programming language is
very critical and important and it play the key role in software, so decid-
ing that uses from which programming language is a little deep subject[8].
There are a number of reasons that whey choosing technology is important:
Time to Code in a project the time is one the important things because after
considering all problem of system the system should complete in specified
durations so time that coding of a system take is very important for project
because if the coding of system take a lot of time the project well not finish
in project schedule. Execution Speed it is also a good reason to choosing the
right technology the system we want develop in which technology will exe-
cution efficiently Code Maintenance Choosing the right technology from the
standpoint of code maintenance is critical, considering to which technology
code maintenances is easy is important because every we can maintenances
our code the coding become easy. I chooses PHP language especially (Lar-
avel) framework and MYSQLI database in my project, below is the reason
why I chooses this technologies in my project. The Laravel framework is
MVC(model-view-controller) The Laravel frame- work has lots of class li-
brary so it make easy the coding and prevent from lots of time and let the
developer to focus more on system. we worked with this framework a lot and
working with this framework is easy for me and I had more experience with
this framework.

### Model-View-Controller:
One positive point of Laravel framework is the MVC architecture because
this architecture is very easy to use and clear. The logic is in controller,
the presentation or clearly the HTML code that used to show data to end
user is in view, the database interaction is in model so adding new feature is
possible at any time because for adding new feature the developer just add
new controllers, new views and new models[9]

### Laravel
The most important reason that we chooses Laravel framework is this reason,
this framework has any kind of class library so the developer don’t need to
code a lot. Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by
Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following
the modelviewcontroller (MVC) architectural pattern. Some of the features
of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency
manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid
in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syn-
tactic sugar[10]. As of March 2015, Laravel is regarded as one of the most
popular PHP frameworks, together with Symfony, Zend, CodeIgniter, Yii2
and others. Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant
syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience
to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of develop-
ment by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such
as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching. Laravel aims to make the
development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing ap-
plication functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end,
we’ve attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web
frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as
Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.
Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for
large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive
migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the
tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL, often referred to as Postgres, is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robust features, extensibility, and performance. It is a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from small personal projects to large enterprise-level databases. Here's some detailed information about PostgreSQL:
1.Web Applications: Many web applications and content management systems use PostgreSQL for data storage.
2.Geospatial Applications: PostgreSQL's support for geospatial data makes it suitable for GIS applications.
3.Data Warehousing: It can be used for data warehousing and analytics.
4.Financial Systems: PostgreSQL's ACID compliance makes it a good fit for financial applications.
5.Content Management Systems (CMS): Several popular CMS platforms, like Drupal and WordPress, support PostgreSQL as a database backend.
6.Enterprise Applications: PostgreSQL is used in various enterprise-level applications for data storage and management.
7.Research and Academia: It is often used in academic and research environments for data analysis and research databases.
